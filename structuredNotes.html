                The internet is a large amount of computers connected                              via a 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99PcP0aFNE">series of                    tubes</a>
                that use these tubes to talk to each other. OK the internet                        <b>isn't</b>
                a series of tubes, but it is a vast quantity of                                    computers networked together. Some of these computers are standard                 personal computers, while some of them are 
                <b>servers</b>
                . These servers contain vast amounts of data that personal                         computers can request access to via 
                <b>HTTP requests</b>
                . The server then sends the requested information back to the                      personal computer which displays it in a 
                <b>web browser</b>
                .

                they just might learn how, until then they wil simply process the                  whatever inputs you give it literally. And I mean literally

                <em>Inline Elements</em>
                appear on the same line upon which they were created. Whereas 
                <em>block elements</em>
                have a box drawn around the elemnts inside them.

            <b>How Websites Work</b>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Websites display content by utilizing programming 
                <b>languages</b>
                . The two languages that this section focuses on are
                <b>CSS</b>
                and
                <b>HTML</b>
                .
                <b>CSS</b>
                files are the style of the site, while
                <b>HTML</b>
                files control the structure of the site.
                If there any interactive parts of the site they are usually                       handled with
                <b>Javascript</b>
                .
                Programers also utilizes the 
                <b>DOM</b> 
                (document object model) to structure pages.

                <b>HTML</b>
                is the language of the web and as such it has rules and syntax.
                A basic "word" in
                <b>HTML</b>
                is known as a 
                <b>tag</b>
                a web browser turns 
                <b>tags</b>
                into 
                <b>elements</b> Using the 
                <b>DOM</b>
                tree. Everything between the starting tag and the ending tag is                   reffered to as 
                <b>content</b>
                . All 
                <b>tags</b>
                have a type as well as attributes and values.

            <b>Everything Is A Box</b>

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmqwbZa6_w">Whats in the                 box?</a>
                Well everything is in the box, or more correctly 
                <b>A</b> 
                box. Every thing on a website is in a box, and within that box are                 more boxes. Turns out it's boxes all the way down.
                When building a web page one must think of how to 
                <b>boxify</b>
                their designs. One defines boxes with the div
                <b>tag</b>
                and applies styles to them and gives them attributes.
