                The internet is a large amount of computers connected via a
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99PcP0aFNE">series of tubes</a>
                that use these tubes to talk to each other. Ok the internet
                <strong>isn't</strong>
                a series of tubes, but it is a vast quantity of computers networked together. Some of these computers are standard personal computers, while some of them are
                <strong>servers.</strong>
                These servers contain vast amounts of data that personal computers can request access to via
                <strong>HTTP requests.</strong>
                The server then sends the requested information back to the personal computer which then displays it in a
                <strong>web browser.</strong>

                <strong>HTML</strong>
                (hypertext markup language) is made of various
                <strong>elements.</strong>
                In order to tell the computer what kind of
                <strong>elements</strong>
                to use we use various
                <strong>tags.</strong>

                Inline and Block Elements
            </div>
            <p>
                Elements in HTML documents are either
                <strong>inline</strong>
                or
                <strong>block.</strong>
                Inline elements appear on the same line on which they were created. Whereas block elements draw a box around the
                <strong>elements</strong>
                inside of them.

            <div class="subheader" id="howwebsiteswork">How Websites Work</div>
            <p>
                Websites display content by utilizing programming
                <strong>languages</strong>
                . The two languages that this section focuses on are
                <strong>CSS</strong>
                and
                <strong>HTML.</strong>
                CSS files are the style of the site, while HTML files control the structure of the site. If there are any interactive parts on a site they are usually handles with
                <strong>javascript.</strong>
                Programmers also utilize the
                <strong>DOM</strong>
                (document object model) to structure pages.

            <div class="subheader"> Everything is a Box</div>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmqwbZa6_w">What's in the box?</a>
                Well everything is in the box, or more correctly
                <b>a</b>
                box. Everything on a website is in a box, and within that box are boxes. Turns out it's boxes all the way down. When a building a web page one must think of how to
                <strong>boxify</strong>
                their designs. One defines boxes with the div
                <strong>tag</strong>
                and applies styles to them and gives them attributes.

            <p>
                <strong>HTML</strong>
                is the language of the web and as such it has rules and syntax. A basic "word" in
                <strong>HTML</strong>
                is known as a
                <strong>tag</strong>
                a web browser turns
                <strong>tags</strong>
                into
                <strong>elements</strong>
                using the
                <strong>DOM</strong>
                tree. Everything between the starting tag and the ending tag is referred to as
                <strong>content</strong>
                . All
                <strong>tags</strong>
                have a type as well as attributes and values.

            <p>
                <strong>CSS</strong>
                stands for cascading style sheets. The word
                <strong>cascading</strong>
                in this context refers to the fact that the most specific rule gets applied. For each html document you can reference several
                <strong>css</strong>
                files.
                In css you first write a
                <strong>selector</strong>
                which determines what that
                <strong>css elemnt</strong>
                gets applied to.

            <div class="subheader">Style</div>
            <p>
                In programming they word
                <em>style</em>
                can refer to many different things. Such as
            </p>
