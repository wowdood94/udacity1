<h1> Major Ideas</h1>

<b>How it all fits together</b>
<p>The internet is a large amount of computers connected via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99PcP0aFNE">series of tubes</a> that use these tubes to talk to each other. OK the internet <b>isn't</b> a series of tubes, but it is a vast quantity of computers networked together. Some of these computers are standard personal computers, while some of them are <b>servers</b>. These servers contain vast amounts of data that personal computers can request access to via <b>HTTP requests</b>. The server then sends the requested information back to the personal computer which displays it in a <b>web browser</b>.

<b>Tages and Elements</b>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. In order to tell the computer what kind of element to use we use various <b>tags</b>. Visit <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp"> here</a> for a comprehensive list.</p>
<b>The problem with computers</b>
<p>Computers cannot think yet; although once I take Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009"> machine learning degree</a> they just might learn how, until then they wil simply process the whatever inputs you give it literally. And I mean literally <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literally">literally</a>.
</p>
<b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
<p>Elements in HTML documents are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. <em>Inline Elements</em> appear on the same line upon which they were created. Whereas <em>block elements</em> have a box drawn around the elemnts inside them.
